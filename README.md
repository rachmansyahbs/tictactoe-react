# TIC TAC TOE - with React

Just another React-based app.
This is my take on Tic Tac Toe game, implemented with React and built with Webpack.

Don't forget
```
npm install
```


#### Commands:
```
npm run build
```
Run webpack to create bundle under directory 'build'

```
npm run start
```
Start webpack-dev-server (iframe mode) with HMR.
The default configuration omitted '--open', access <a href="http://localhost:8080/webpack-dev-server/">http://localhost:8080/webpack-dev-server/</a> to preview.


#### Future Works
This implementation is far from perfect, mainly built to get my feet wet with using React and tinkering with webpack config.
Let me know if this project helps you in one way or another!
