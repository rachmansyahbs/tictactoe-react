# TIC TAC TOE - with React

Just another React-based app.
This is my take on Tic Tac Toe game, implemented with React and built with Webpack.

Don't forget
```
npm install
```


#### Commands:
```
npm run preview
```
Start webpack-dev-server (iframe mode) with HMR.

```
npm run build
```
Run webpack using production configuration and write to build directory

```
npm run serve
```
Serve the static files under build directory (using <a href="https://www.npmjs.com/package/http-server">http-server</a>)


#### Future Works
This implementation is far from perfect, mainly built to get my feet wet with using React and tinkering with webpack config.
Let me know if this project helps you in one way or another!
